# Spring Boot REST API with Hibernate and PostgreSQL

## Overview

This project presents a straightforward RESTful API constructed with Spring Boot, Hibernate, PostgreSQL, and Docker. It serves as a foundational structure for developing scalable and efficient web applications requiring robust backend services.

## Key Features

- **Spring Boot:** Utilizes Spring Boot to swiftly set up and deploy standalone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
  
- **Hibernate:** Integrates Hibernate ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for simplified database access and a potent, high-performance object-relational mapping solution.
  
- **PostgreSQL:** Implements PostgreSQL, an open-source relational database management system recognized for its reliability, robustness, and feature-rich capabilities.
  
- **Docker:** Employs Docker for containerization, facilitating consistent deployment across various environments and streamlining dependency management.

## Functionality

The API offers CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for resource management, providing endpoints to:

- Retrieve all resources.
- Retrieve a specific resource by its unique identifier.
- Create a new resource.
- Update an existing resource.
- Delete a resource by its unique identifier.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Java JDK 8 or higher
- Maven
- Docker

With this setup, you can seamlessly run and interact with the API.
